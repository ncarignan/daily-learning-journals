#301 Day 2

The last two days were great. I enjoyed working with Frederick today, he certainly is a wealth of information.
He remembered most of what we needed for this code and had a few artifacts to refer to from his last 301 class. The way they did it was a bit different but it helped us structure our ideas.
The way we added properties to the newArticles was the same way as the example in the starter code using $newArticle.find() and then added the data. It was interesting to compare with Jeff K how he did his code with Joy because they used $('article:last li:first-child') //I believe- I am only doing this from memory// and were basically selecting the last article, then focusing on a specific element whereas using the newArticle makes more sense and is simpler because we are already adding .html(this) , this referring to the newArticle in article.
