# Journal day 8

Today was so much more of a breeze than yesterday. Yesterday I got stuck on one line of code that I placed outside of a for loop and it was causing no errors, it just wasn't printing the data I wanted. I was able to console.log every single line of the function and return all correct data points but because it was just not storing the data after the for loop I couldn't tell what was wrong. I wont forget that bug.
Looking forward to more CSS tomorrow.
