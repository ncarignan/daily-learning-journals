#Journal day 20

This has been such a great class. Presenting went so well. I felt encouraged by everyone in the class and by the tas and teachers. I was really proud or our project and all the projects. We had to make one last edit before we were done but that was not stressful and we had the whole day to prepare.

Thank you so much to  all the tas and Sam and Allie, I can't wait for next semester.
