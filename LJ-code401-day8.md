#Day 8
I think the binary and bitmap lessons are deprecated and am unsure how this prepares me for a job
I know realize that it is teaching us promises from a low level to prepare us from real promises
I actually enjoyed figuring it out but I know a lot of people were stressed over it. I found it funny that some of the amazon reps we were working with at a coffee and code meetup were finding it difficult. I have also begun to convert my 301 project code to some of the things we have learned- it would be pretty cool if we could pair up again in 401 and continue working on it.
