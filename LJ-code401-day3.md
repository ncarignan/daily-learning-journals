# Day 3

I'll probably write more next week but its getting late.
This week has been relatively simple but todays lab was sucky, I was exhausted so i took a siesta and have been working on it since. There is something I am doing different than the lecture and its bugging me.
Anyway, you are doing good Vinicio, I just wish the 401 course picked up where 301 left off.
