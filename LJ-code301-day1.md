#301 Day 1

Today was great.
First we had the golden rule introduction which was just a repeat of last section's and went too long. but it was fine.

Second we had labs which were great. I finished early and went to sleep in the room we would have lecture in but two groups of 401 were still in there so I just listened to music. When I did the SMACCS lab i thought we were supposed to scale it for mobile at the same time, so I did that too.

Third we had lecture which I was pretty tired by and felt was a little dragged out. I think some of my classmates may have not done the readings, as per their questions.

Fourth we whiteboarded which was great with Rob. He had a pretty good idea I think of how to solve it but he basically said :what are your ideas; to which I replied: we should split at the space and slice at the 0 index. He introcuced me to .map to make that easier and then drew it up. It was clean, fast, collaborative and easy. I think rob had the whole function ready in his head when he started but he wanted to make sure I got it myself so he asked first. It took me a moment longer than it should have to think through(I attribute this to an acute lack of sleep) but he let me discover it instead of giving me his though process first. Good Job Rob!

Fifth I did the problem and my readings, yay i'm done, lets do day two. Let day2 = now.
