# Day 38

Honestly, I am not finding react/redux very hard. what I am finding hard is working with a foggy brain and having my fevers keep rolling in and out, I really need to kick this thing. I have cut out drinking and working out in the hopes of giving my body all the resources it can muster but I am still exhausted when the coughing starts and my body can't seem to fight this.
