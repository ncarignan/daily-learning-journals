## What I learned today

- Github
  -  Add Commit Push. That needs to be done regularly. I was advised that pushing could be saved as it would store multiple commits so we don't have to input the password all the time. Also, creating a repository and accessing files on github makes a lot more sense. I used to be confused when taking things from github for my linux files and had to just copy paste into the terminal. now it all makes sense.

- CSS
  - Css is tough. I feel likke there is a generic style one could develop to get things going. Or pattern if you will. But right now I have to think through: what needs editing, what haven't I looked at yet, each time that I start another div or class etc.
  
- Javascript
  - js makes sense and is no trouble. I enjoy working through it and can already see the modularity take shape. Can't wait to use it for more complex things. Hopefully I can keep up.

- HTML rules
  - I had to brush up on some of the rules today. All of the syntax is much easier when its all in front of me. However, I believe I am getting the hang of it,

- Other
  - My main problem at this time isnt the code, it is my typing speed. I feel like I am terrible at using the carrots, slashes, quotes, brackets etc. Really anything that uses my pinky is really slow for me. I am also not terribly fast in gerneral. I see my seat partner typing at 100 wpm easy and it humbles me. I will try to get faster.
