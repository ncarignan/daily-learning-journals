#Journal day 16

I do not have that much to say today other than the fact that I have done some great work on the game logic. I really love solving the puzzles of getting the game to work and organizing all the functions. I feel that I will be done by noon tomorrow and I hope to have the js interacting fully with the page by 5:00
