#Day 20

This has been a great week. I really enjoyed my team and the progress we made. We intend to carry our project into a more professional state in the future, hopefully as soon as we get back we can start putting in a few hours each week to expand on its functionality.
I thought presentation was fine. I was asked to switch to matt's computer and didnt have enough practice before hand to make it smooth. His scroll is backwards and his left click is his right click and only tapping the pad left clicks. So i bungled a few things during presentation.
One thing to note is that I believe we were the first group to integrate persistent logins in our database. I think sam glanced over that but similar to the weather vacation search app, we store the login, password, favorite recipes, etc of the user in our db too. you can log in from any computer.
