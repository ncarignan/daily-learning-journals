# Day 32

I like react. I do feel that redux really sucks though. I do not think that redux's benefits outweigh the operational cost of memory and processing speed. I would not employ it in my startup, I would guide my employees to properly set up an app that utilizes the full power of react. I wonder if the efficiency killers of react arent the base library but all the addons that people use to understand it or simplify it.
