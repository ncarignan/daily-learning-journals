## What I learned today


-Pear learning was fun. Did you know that the Swedes are obsessed with Pears. They have pear cider as a popular drink. I am a reputable source on this: I have been to Ikea at least three times.

-Seriously though, I am a little tired after this week but I enjoyed the Pears. Nick and I both meshed well and he is a faster typer while I am faster conceptually so we hashed some good code out in under an hour and finished the stretch goals extremely quickly too. I think I will just store all of my text in a single set of nested arrays from now on. Honestly I will probably store all functions and text and anything else that I can in arrays because of just how neat it keeps the code and how easy editing patterns become.

- I havent tackled it yet, though I started the rudimentary formatting, I am excited to start with aligning blocks properly in my CSS. It has been bugging me that I cannot make my sites look the way I want to fully. I feel that now they will at least look like my sketches even if I am still only coding the basics.
