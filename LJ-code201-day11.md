##Day 11

I found today a bit hard if only because I was tired. I left at 4 with my code broken and went to sleep. I didnt wake up until a few hours ago and I still have broken code. I'm not worried about it I just wish I had kept a more strict sleeping schedule over the weekend to keep me on track. My body seems to want to revert back to night shift immediately and easily. The code all makes sense to me and I am so close to having it all working and storing the data but theres a few typos I think that I am just not seeing.
