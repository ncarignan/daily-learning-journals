#Day 10
Today was great. I am still in the process of deciding which class to take. I really want to take asp.net for the OOD principles but am concerned about future job market.. To be honest though I know I could learn more languages quick so I think that is the class I will take. I learned a lot about SQL this week and working with Rob and again with Fred was great, they are good partners.
